>Make file in python is used like automation system or shortcuts platform to build the project:

- Install Dependencies.
- Create/Remove/Initial the virtual Environment.
- Generate the start point files (map, data, assets)
- Install Packages
- Or even format the code with a specific code standard like `flake8`

### How to use it
```python
make run
```
**To install Dependencies**
```python
make install
make run-venv
```
**Clean Files**
```css
make clean
```
**remove everything (venv)**
```css
make fclean
```

# Make For This Project

### 1) `make install`
>_Should prepare the environment, so your code can run_

**What should do exactly**
- install dependencies (flake8, mypy, maybe colorama, etc.)
- usually using: `pip install -r requirements`

### 2) `make run`
>_Run your program **Normally**_

- Execute main script with `Python`.
- With a default/specific config file.

### 3) `make Debug`
>_Run your program but inside a debugger_

**Using Python built-in debugger (`pdb`)**
_Example_
```css
python3 -m pdb a_maze_ing.py config.txt
```
Then you can step through code (step...step), inspect variables, etc.

### 4) `make clean`
>Remove All garbage/cache files generated by python tools

**What should delete**
- `__pycache__/`
- `*.pyc`
- `.mypy_cache/`
- `.pytest_cache/` (if you use pytest)
- `.ruff_cache/` (if you ever use ruff)

**_Note:_**
clean = "remove temporary python-generated junk files"

### 5) `make lint`
==The subject explicitly demands this command:==
>Used to check the code style and format/show rules to be followed.

It must run:
```js
flake8 .
mypy . --warn-return-any --warn-unused-ignores --ignore-missing-imports \
       --disallow-untyped-defs --check-untyped-defs=
```

### 6) `make lint-strict`
Runs:
```js
flake8 .
mypy . --strict
```
_lint-strict = "hard mode mypy check"_
